# Blog Post API
 Certainly! Here's a sample README file for a project involving a blog post API built using Express.js and TypeScript with MongoDB as the database:

# Technologies Used
- **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It brings static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- **MongoDB:** A popular NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.
- **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modelling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web development.
